Hello! I’m Rosan John Redsin J, a passionate and creative 3D modeling artist with a strong foundation in Blender and various other modeling software. 
Currently working as a freelance student, I specialize in creating visually stunning models and interactive assets. 
I’m always exploring new techniques, experimenting with different styles, and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. 
On this GitHub, you will find a collection of my projects, ranging from 3D modeling to scripting and automation. 
I enjoy challenging myself with new concepts, and I am constantly learning and improving my skills. 
Feel free to check out my repositories, contribute, or reach out if you want to collaborate!
