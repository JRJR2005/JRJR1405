<tr><th><h1>ABOUT ME</h1></th></tr>
<tr><td><h2>I m J Rosan John Redsin </h2></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>A passionate software development student with a strong academic background in computer science, driven by a desire to create impactful applications and games. 
Proficient in C# and C++, I have developed my skills as both a game developer and app developer through hands-on projects like "Job Skills Adventure" and "Little Ice Age," where I focused on gameplay mechanics, user experience, and project management. 
My experience in these projects has enhanced my problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, enabling me to develop innovative solutions to complex challenges.
In addition to programming, I have a keen interest in 3D modeling and web development, which I explore through self-driven projects and coursework. I believe in the power of collaboration and have actively participated in team projects, where I enjoyed sharing ideas and learning from others. 
I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends and technologies. 
Eager to apply my skills in an entry-level position, I am excited to contribute to a dynamic organization while furthering my growth as a software and app developer.
